# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Aurora

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a browser-based interactive synthesizer that combines sound generation with real time visual feedback. Users will be able to play notes and see visuals that respond dynamically to the audio and will be using JavaScript libraries like Tone.js and p5.js. 

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software will be a standalone web app that allows users to trigger musical notes using their keyboard and visualize those notes in real time. It will use Tone.js to generate synthesizer sounds and p5.js to draw reactive visuals that respond to audio properties like amplitude and frequency spectrum. Users will be able to select different waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth) and also interact with basic sound parameters such as envelope settings. Visual elements—such as shapes, colour fields, and animations will shift, or change in response to the generated sound. The project will focus on clear user interaction, responsive design, and artistic expression. All code will be written in JavaScript with HTML/CSS for layout, and managed via GitHub. Although this project won’t simulate a real plugin, it builds foundational skills in audio-visual development and creative coding.

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?
Not combining with another course. 

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?

•	A working web-based synthesizer that plays notes via keyboard
•	Basic visuals that respond to sound amplitude or waveform
•	Simple interface with working buttons or controls


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

•	Ability to switch between multiple waveform types
•	Interactive UI with dropdowns to change synth parameters
•	Multiple visual modes or styles 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

•	Live control of synth and visual parameters
•	Exportable visuals or ability to record performance
•	README and DESIGN file


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

My next steps are to learn more and get in depth into both Tone.js and p5.js. I need to learn how to trigger synth notes and adjust audio parameters in Tone.js, and how to use p5.js’s sound analysis tools to draw visuals that react to sound in real time. I’ll begin by creating small prototypes that separate audio and visuals and then combine them into a single app. I’ll also explore examples of audio-reactive visuals to inspire my visual designs. Additional skills include working with modular JavaScript, responsive UI design. Once the base app is working, I plan to explore more creative visual modes and document how this browser project could turn into a plugin-based tool in the future.
